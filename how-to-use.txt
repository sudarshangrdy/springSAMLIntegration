Instructions on running the "Used Car Portal" Application (SAML Version) 
========================================================================

Steps: 

1. Install JDK 17 from the link below. Set JAVA_HOME to installation directory ( e.g C:\devtools\jdk-17.0.1)

    https://jdk.java.net/17/
    
    Note : It's not necessary that JDK 17 needs to be installed. 
           You can use any JDK >= Version 11 but update pom.xml 
    

2. Install Maven from the following site
    
    https://maven.apache.org/install.html
    
    Use "mvn --version" to make sure that JDK 17 is taken. 
    

3. Create files private.key and certificate.crt for the Application.

	- Review Lecture "Use samltool.com to create RSA keys and Certificate"
	- These files must be stored in directory "main/resources/credentials"  


4. Create the SAML 2.0 Integration Application from the Okta Console (See file okta-setup.txt for Demo setup)

	- Make sure you set the correct SP Endpoints as expected by Spring Boot
	- Create the groups used by the application - cars.user and cars.admin
	- Assign yourself to the Application and groups 
	- Extract IDP Metadata to a file called "main/resources/okta-metadata.yml"
	- Review Lecture "Spring Boot SAML Integration Code Walkthrough"
	- Review lecture "Okta Setup for Spring Boot"


5. Create the following application files (as indicated in steps 3 and 4)

	- main/resources/credentials/private.key
	- main/resources/credentials/certificate.key
	- main/resources/okta-metadata.yml
